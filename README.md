====

Fasta - Library of FASTA related functionality

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Fasta;

my %counts = Fasta.count-bases($file);
say %counts{"Carsonella ruddii"};     # bag with frequencies

my %sequences = Fasta.sequences($file);
say %sequences{"Carsonella ruddii"};  # sequence as string
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

A library for Fasta processing related logic.

count-bases
-----------

```raku
my %labels = Fasta.count-bases($file);
say %label{"Carsonella ruddii"};  # bag with frequencies
```

Takes the name of a Fasta file, and creates a hash with labels encountered as keys, and a Bag with the nucleotide letters and their frequencies.

sequences
---------

```raku
my %sequences = Fasta.sequences($file);
say %sequences{"Carsonella ruddii"};  # sequence as string
```

Takes the name of a Fasta file, and creates a hash with labels encountered as keys, and a string with the actual sequence.
